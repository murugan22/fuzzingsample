Bytecode Parser and Fuzzer
This project demonstrates a simple Flask web application that serves as a Bytecode Parser and Fuzzer. The application allows you to upload bytecode files, parse them, identify errors, and generate values based on those errors.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Flask (You can install Flask via pip install Flask)
Project Structure
app.py: The main application file containing the Flask web application code.
templates/upload.html: An HTML template for the file upload interface.
How to Run
Clone this repository or download the code.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Install Flask if you haven't already:

shell
Copy code
pip install Flask
Run the Flask application:

shell
Copy code
python app.py
Access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Use the provided web interface to upload bytecode files (e.g., .txt files with TLV-encoded data).

Usage
Upload a bytecode file using the provided form.

The application will parse the uploaded file, generate error codes (e.g., "Incomplete data," "Missing size," "Incorrect byte length"), and print them to the console.

The Fuzzer component in the code will generate values based on the error codes.

The generated values will be printed to the console as well.

Customization
You can customize the error code generation logic in the Fuzzer class to match your specific project requirements.
You can adapt the parser in the TLVParser class to handle different TLV formats or nested TLVs.
Example Bytecode File
For testing purposes, you can use the following sample TLV-encoded bytecode in a text file (e.g., sample_bytecode.txt):
